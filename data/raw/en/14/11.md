सर्वद्वारेषु देहेऽस्मिन्प्रकाश उपजायते ।  
ज्ञानं यदा तदा विद्याद्विवृद्धं सत्त्वमित्युत ॥११॥

### Translation:

**The manifestations of the mode of goodness can be experienced when all the gates of the body are illuminated by knowledge.**

### Purport:

There are nine gates in the body: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, the genitals and the anus. When every gate is illuminated by the symptoms of goodness, it should be understood that one has developed the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, one can see things in the right position, one can hear things in the right position, and one can taste things in the right position. One becomes cleansed inside and outside. In every gate there is development of the symptoms of happiness, and that is the position of goodness.
