यदा सत्त्वे प्रवृद्धे तु प्रलयं याति देहभृत् ।  
तदोत्तमविदां लोकानमलान्प्रतिपद्यते ॥१४॥

yadā sattve pravṛddhe tu  
pralayaḿ yāti deha-bhṛt  
tadottama-vidāḿ lokān  
amalān pratipadyate



### Translation:

**When one dies in the mode of goodness, he attains to the pure higher planets of the great sages.**

### Purport:

One in goodness attains higher planetary systems, like Brahmaloka or Janoloka, and there enjoys godly happiness. The word amalan is significant; it means "free from the modes of passion and ignorance." There are impurities in the material world, but the mode of goodness is the purest form of existence in the material world. There are different kinds of planets for different kinds of living entities. Those who die in the mode of goodness are elevated to the planets where great sages and great devotees live.
