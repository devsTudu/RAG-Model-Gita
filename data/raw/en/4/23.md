गतसङ्गस्य मुक्तस्य ज्ञानावस्थितचेतसः ।  
यज्ञायाचरतः कर्म समग्रं प्रविलीयते ॥२३॥

gata-sańgasya muktasya  
jñānāvasthita-cetasaḥ  
yajñāyācarataḥ karma  
samagraḿ pravilīyate



### Translation:

**The work of a man who is unattached to the modes of material nature and who is fully situated in transcendental knowledge merges entirely into transcendence.**

### Purport:

Becoming fully Krishna conscious, one is freed from all dualities and thus is free from the contaminations of the material modes. He can become liberated because he knows his constitutional position in relationship with Krishna, and thus his mind cannot be drawn from Krishna consciousness. Consequently, whatever he does, he does for Krishna, who is the primeval Vishnu. Therefore, all his works are technically sacrifices because sacrifice aims at satisfying the Supreme Person, Vishnu, Krishna. The resultant reactions to all such work certainly merge into transcendence, and one does not suffer material effects.
