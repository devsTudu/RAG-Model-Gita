इदमद्य मया लब्धमिमं प्राप्स्ये मनोरथम् ।  
इदमस्तीदमपि मे भविष्यति पुनर्धनम् ॥१३॥  
असौ मया हतः शत्रुर्हनिष्ये चापरानपि ।  
ईश्वरोऽहमहं भोगी सिद्धोऽहं बलवान्सुखी ॥१४॥  
आढ्योऽभिजनवानस्मि कोऽन्योऽस्ति सदृशो मया ।  
यक्ष्ये दास्यामि मोदिष्य इत्यज्ञानविमोहिताः ॥१५॥

### Translation:

**The demoniac person thinks: "So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him, and my other enemies will also be killed. I am the lord of everything. I am the enjoyer. I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice." In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance.**
