निश्चयं शृणु मे तत्र त्यागे भरतसत्तम ।  
त्यागो हि पुरुषव्याघ्र त्रिविधः संप्रकीर्तितः ॥४॥

niścayaḿ śṛṇu me tatra  
tyāge bharata-sattama  
tyāgo hi puruṣa-vyāghra  
tri-vidhaḥ samprakīrtitaḥ



### Translation:

**O best of the Bharatas, now hear My judgment about renunciation. O tiger among men, renunciation is declared in the scriptures to be of three kinds.**

### Purport:

Although there are differences of opinion about renunciation, here the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna, gives His judgment, which should be taken as final. After all, the Vedas are different laws given by the Lord. Here the Lord is personally present, and His word should be taken as final. The Lord says that the process of renunciation should be considered in terms of the modes of material nature in which they are performed.
