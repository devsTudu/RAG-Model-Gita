यया तु धर्मकामार्थान्धृत्या धारयतेऽर्जुन ।  
प्रसङ्गेन फलाकाङ्क्षी धृतिः सा पार्थ राजसी ॥३४॥

yayā tu dharma-kāmārthān  
dhṛtyā dhārayate 'rjuna  
prasańgena phalākāńkṣī  
dhṛtiḥ sā pārtha rājasī



### Translation:

**But that determination by which one holds fast to fruitive results in religion, economic development and sense gratification is of the nature of passion, O Arjuna.**

### Purport:

Any person who is always desirous of fruitive results in religious or economic activities, whose only desire is sense gratification, and whose mind, life and senses are thus engaged is in the mode of passion.
