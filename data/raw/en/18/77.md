तच्च संस्मृत्य संस्मृत्य रूपमत्यद्भुतं हरेः ।  
विस्मयो मे महान् राजन्हृष्यामि च पुनः पुनः ॥७७॥

### Translation:

**O King, as I remember the wonderful form of Lord Krishna, I am struck with wonder more and more, and I rejoice again and again.**

### Purport:

It appears that Sanjaya also, by the grace of Vyasa, could see the universal form Krishna exhibited to Arjuna. It is, of course, said that Lord Krishna had never exhibited such a form before. It was exhibited to Arjuna only, yet some great devotees could also see the universal form of Krishna when it was shown to Arjuna, and Vyasa was one of them. He is one of the great devotees of the Lord, and he is considered to be a powerful incarnation of Krishna. Vyasa disclosed this to his disciple Sanjaya, who remembered that wonderful form of Krishna exhibited to Arjuna and enjoyed it repeatedly.
