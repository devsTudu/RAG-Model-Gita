प्रवृत्तिं च निवृत्तिं च कार्याकार्ये भयाभये ।  
बन्धं मोक्षं च या वेत्ति बुद्धिः सा पार्थ सात्त्विकी ॥३०॥

pravṛttiḿ ca nivṛttiḿ ca  
kāryākārye bhayābhaye  
bandhaḿ mokṣaḿ ca yā vetti  
buddhiḥ sā pārtha sāttvikī



### Translation:

**O son of Pritha, that understanding by which one knows what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, what is to be feared and what is not to be feared, what is binding and what is liberating, is in the mode of goodness.**

### Purport:

Performing actions in terms of the directions of the scriptures is called pravritti, or executing actions that deserve to be performed. And actions which are not so directed are not to be performed. One who does not know the scriptural directions becomes entangled in the actions and reactions of work. Understanding which discriminates by intelligence is situated in the mode of goodness.
