एतान्यपि तु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा फलानि च ।  
कर्तव्यानीति मे पार्थ निश्चितं मतमुत्तमम् ॥६॥

etāny api tu karmāṇi  
sańgaḿ tyaktvā phalāni ca  
kartavyānīti me pārtha  
niścitaḿ matam uttamam



### Translation:

**All these activities should be performed without attachment or any expectation of result. They should be performed as a matter of duty, O son of Pritha. That is My final opinion.**

### Purport:

Although all sacrifices are purifying, one should not expect any result by such performances. In other words, all sacrifices which are meant for material advancement in life should be given up, but sacrifices that purify one's existence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped. Everything that leads to Krishna consciousness must be encouraged. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional service to the Lord should be accepted. That is the highest criterion of religion. A devotee of the Lord should accept any kind of work, sacrifice or charity which will help him in the discharge of devotional service to the Lord.
