य इमं परमं गुह्यं मद्भक्तेष्वभिधास्यति ।  
भक्तिं मयि परां कृत्वा मामेवैष्यत्यसंशयः ॥६८॥

### Translation:

**For one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, pure devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.**

### Purport:

Generally it is advised that Bhagavad-gita be discussed amongst the devotees only, for those who are not devotees will understand neither Krishna nor Bhagavad-gita. Those who do not accept Krishna as He is and Bhagavad-gita as it is should not try to explain Bhagavad-gita whimsically and become offenders. Bhagavad-gita should be explained to persons who are ready to accept Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present Bhagavad-gita as it is will advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead.
