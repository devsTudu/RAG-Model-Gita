धृत्या यया धारयते मनःप्राणेन्द्रियक्रियाः ।  
योगेनाव्यभिचारिण्या धृतिः सा पार्थ सात्त्विकी ॥३३॥

dhṛtyā yayā dhārayate  
manaḥ-prāṇendriya-kriyāḥ  
yogenāvyabhicāriṇyā  
dhṛtiḥ sā pārtha sāttvikī



### Translation:

**O son of Pritha, that determination which is unbreakable, which is sustained with steadfastness by yoga practice, and which thus controls the activities of the mind, life and senses is determination in the mode of goodness.**

### Purport:

Yoga is a means to understand the Supreme Soul. One who is steadily fixed in the Supreme Soul with determination, concentrating one's mind, life and sensory activities on the Supreme, engages in Krishna consciousness. That sort of determination is in the mode of goodness. The word avyabhicarinya is very significant, for it indicates that persons who are engaged in Krishna consciousness are never deviated by any other activity.
