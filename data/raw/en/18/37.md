यत्तदग्रे विषमिव परिणामेऽमृतोपमम् ।  
तत्सुखं सात्त्विकं प्रोक्तमात्मबुद्धिप्रसादजम् ॥३७॥

yat tad agre viṣam iva  
pariṇāme 'mṛtopamam  
tat sukhaḿ sāttvikaḿ proktam  
ātma-buddhi-prasāda-jam



### Translation:

**That which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness.**

### Purport:

In the pursuit of self-realization, one has to follow many rules and regulations to control the mind and the senses and to concentrate the mind on the self. All these procedures are very difficult, bitter like poison, but if one is successful in following the regulations and comes to the transcendental position, he begins to drink real nectar, and he enjoys life.
