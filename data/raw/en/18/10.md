# Text 10

न द्वेष्ट्यकुशलं कर्म कुशले नानुषज्जते ।  
त्यागी सत्त्वसमाविष्टो मेधावी छिन्नसंशयः ॥१०॥

na dveṣṭy akuśalaḿ karma  
kuśale nānuṣajjate  
tyāgī sattva-samāviṣṭo  
medhāvī chinna-saḿśayaḥ



### Translation:

**The intelligent renouncer situated in the mode of goodness, neither hateful of inauspicious work nor attached to auspicious work, has no doubts about work.**

### Purport:

A person in Krishna consciousness or in the mode of goodness does not hate anyone or anything which troubles his body. He does work in the proper place and at the proper time without fearing the troublesome effects of his duty. Such a person situated in transcendence should be understood to be most intelligent and beyond all doubts in his activities.
