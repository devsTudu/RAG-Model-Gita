प्रयत्नाद्यतमानस्तु योगी संशुद्धकिल्बिषः ।  
अनेकजन्मसंसिद्धस्ततो याति परां गतिम् ॥४५॥

prayatnād yatamānas tu  
yogī saḿśuddha-kilbiṣaḥ  
aneka-janma-saḿsiddhas  
tato yāti parāḿ gatim



### Translation:

**And when the yogi engages himself with sincere endeavor in making further progress, being washed of all contaminations, then ultimately, achieving perfection after many, many births of practice, he attains the supreme goal.**

### Purport:

A person born in a particularly righteous, aristocratic or sacred family becomes conscious of his favorable condition for executing yoga practice. With determination, therefore, he begins his unfinished task, and thus he completely cleanses himself of all material contaminations. When he is finally free from all contaminations, he attains the supreme perfection -- Krishna consciousness. Krishna consciousness is the perfect stage of being freed of all contaminations. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (7.28):

yesham tv anta-gatam papam

jananam punya-karmanam

te dvandva-moha-nirmukta

bhajante mam dridha-vratah

"After many, many births of executing pious activities, when one is completely freed from all contaminations, and from all illusory dualities, one becomes engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord."
