प्रशान्तमनसं ह्येनं योगिनं सुखमुत्तमम् ।  
उपैति शान्तरजसं ब्रह्मभूतमकल्मषम् ॥२७॥

praśānta-manasaḿ hy enaḿ  
yoginaḿ sukham uttamam  
upaiti śānta-rajasaḿ  
brahma-bhūtam akalmaṣam



### Translation:

**The yogi whose mind is fixed on Me verily attains the highest perfection of transcendental happiness. He is beyond the mode of passion, he realizes his qualitative identity with the Supreme, and thus he is freed from all reactions to past deeds.**

### Purport:

Brahma-bhuta is the state of being free from material contamination and situated in the transcendental service of the Lord. Mad-bhaktim labhate param (Bg. 18.54). One cannot remain in the quality of Brahman, the Absolute, until one's mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord. Sa vai manah krishna-padaravindayoh. To be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, or to remain in Krishna consciousness, is to be factually liberated from the mode of passion and all material contamination.
