नैव तस्य कृतेनार्थो नाकृतेनेह कश्चन ।  
न चास्य सर्वभूतेषु कश्चिदर्थव्यपाश्रयः ॥१८॥

naiva tasya kṛtenārtho  
nākṛteneha kaścana  
na cāsya sarva-bhūteṣu  
kaścid artha-vyapāśrayaḥ



### Translation:

**A self-realized man has no purpose to fulfill in the discharge of his prescribed duties, nor has he any reason not to perform such work. Nor has he any need to depend on any other living being.**

### Purport:

A self-realized man is no longer obliged to perform any prescribed duty, save and except activities in Krishna consciousness. Krishna consciousness is not inactivity either, as will be explained in the following verses. A Krishna conscious man does not take shelter of any person -- man or demigod. Whatever he does in Krishna consciousness is sufficient in the discharge of his obligation.
