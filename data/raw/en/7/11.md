बलं बलवतां चाहं कामरागविवर्जितम् ।  
धर्माविरुद्धो भूतेषु कामोऽस्मि भरतर्षभ ॥११॥

balaḿ balavatāḿ cāhaḿ  
kāma-rāga-vivarjitam  
dharmāviruddho bhūteṣu  
kāmo 'smi bharatarṣabha



### Translation:

**I am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire. I am sex life which is not contrary to religious principles, O lord of the Bharatas [Arjuna].**

### Purport:

The strong man's strength should be applied to protect the weak, not for personal aggression. Similarly, sex life, according to religious principles (dharma), should be for the propagation of children, not otherwise. The responsibility of parents is then to make their offspring Krishna conscious.
