अदेशकाले यद्दानमपात्रेभ्यश्च दीयते ।  
असत्कृतमवज्ञातं तत्तामसमुदाहृतम् ॥२२॥

adeśa-kāle yad dānam  
apātrebhyaś ca dīyate  
asat-kṛtam avajñātaḿ  
tat tāmasam udāhṛtam



### Translation:

**And charity performed at an impure place, at an improper time, to unworthy persons, or without proper attention and respect is said to be in the mode of ignorance.**

### Purport:

Contributions for indulgence in intoxication and gambling are not encouraged here. That sort of contribution is in the mode of ignorance. Such charity is not beneficial; rather, sinful persons are encouraged. Similarly, if a person gives charity to a suitable person but without respect and without attention, that sort of charity is also said to be in the mode of darkness.
