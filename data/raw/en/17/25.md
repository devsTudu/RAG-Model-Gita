तदित्यनभिसन्धाय फलं यज्ञतपःक्रियाः ।  
दानक्रियाश्च विविधाः क्रियन्ते मोक्षकाङ्क्षिभिः ॥२५॥

tad ity anabhisandhāya  
phalaḿ yajña-tapaḥ-kriyāḥ  
dāna-kriyāś ca vividhāḥ  
kriyante mokṣa-kāńkṣibhiḥ



### Translation:

**Without desiring fruitive results, one should perform various kinds of sacrifice, penance and charity with the word tat. The purpose of such transcendental activities is to get free from material entanglement.**

### Purport:

To be elevated to the spiritual position, one should not act for any material gain. Acts should be performed for the ultimate gain of being transferred to the spiritual kingdom, back to home, back to Godhead.
