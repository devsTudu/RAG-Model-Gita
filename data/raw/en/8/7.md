तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च ।  
मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयम् ॥७॥

tasmāt sarveṣu kāleṣu  
mām anusmara yudhya ca  
mayy arpita-mano-buddhir  
mām evaiṣyasy asaḿśayaḥ



### Translation:

**Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of Krishna and at the same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting. With your activities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me without doubt.**

### Purport:

This instruction to Arjuna is very important for all men engaged in material activities. The Lord does not say that one should give up his prescribed duties or engagements. One can continue them and at the same time think of Krishna by chanting Hare Krishna. This will free one from material contamination and engage the mind and intelligence in Krishna. By chanting Krishna's names, one will be transferred to the supreme planet, Krishnaloka, without a doubt.
