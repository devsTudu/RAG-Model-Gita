शुक्लकृष्णे गती ह्येते जगतः शाश्वते मते ।  
एकया यात्यनावृत्तिमन्ययावर्तते पुनः ॥२६॥

śukla-kṛṣṇe gatī hy ete  
jagataḥ śāśvate mate  
ekayā yāty anāvṛttim  
anyayāvartate punaḥ



### Translation:

**According to Vedic opinion, there are two ways of passing from this world -- one in light and one in darkness. When one passes in light, he does not come back; but when one passes in darkness, he returns.**

### Purport:

The same description of departure and return is quoted by Acarya Baladeva Vidyabhushana from the Chandogya Upanishad (5.10.3-5). Those who are fruitive laborers and philosophical speculators from time immemorial are constantly going and coming. Actually they do not attain ultimate salvation, for they do not surrender to Krishna.
