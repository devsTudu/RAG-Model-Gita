अर्जुन उवाच  
किं तद्ब्रह्म किमध्यात्मं किं कर्म पुरुषोत्तम ।  
अधिभूतं च किं प्रोक्तमधिदैवं किमुच्यते ॥१॥

arjuna uvāca  
kiḿ tad brahma kim adhyātmaḿ  
kiḿ karma puruṣottama  
adhibhūtaḿ ca kiḿ proktam  
adhidaivaḿ kim ucyate



### Translation:

**Arjuna inquired: O my Lord, O Supreme Person, what is Brahman? What is the self? What are fruitive activities? What is this material manifestation? And what are the demigods? Please explain this to me.**

### Purport:

In this chapter Lord Krishna answers different questions from Arjuna, beginning with "What is Brahman?" The Lord also explains karma (fruitive activities), devotional service and yoga principles, and devotional service in its pure form. The Srimad-Bhagavatam explains that the Supreme Absolute Truth is known as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. In addition, the living entity, the individual soul, is also called Brahman. Arjuna also inquires about atma, which refers to body, soul and mind. According to the Vedic dictionary, atma refers to the mind, soul, body and senses also.

Arjuna has addressed the Supreme Lord as Purushottama, Supreme Person, which means that he was putting these questions not simply to a friend but to the Supreme Person, knowing Him to be the supreme authority able to give definitive answers.
