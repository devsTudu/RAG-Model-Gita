धूमो रात्रिस्तथा कृष्णः षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम् ।  
तत्र चान्द्रमसं ज्योतिर्योगी प्राप्य निवर्तते ॥ २५॥

dhūmo rātris tathā kṛṣṇaḥ  
ṣaṇ-māsā dakṣiṇāyanam  
tatra cāndramasaḿ jyotir  
yogī prāpya nivartate



### Translation:

**The mystic who passes away from this world during the smoke, the night, the fortnight of the waning moon, or the six months when the sun passes to the south reaches the moon planet but again comes back.**

### Purport:

In the Third Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam Kapila Muni mentions that those who are expert in fruitive activities and sacrificial methods on earth attain to the moon at death. These elevated souls live on the moon for about 10,000 years (by demigod calculations) and enjoy life by drinking soma-rasa. They eventually return to earth. This means that on the moon there are higher classes of living beings, though they may not be perceived by the gross senses.
