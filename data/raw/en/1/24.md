सञ्जय उवाच  
एवमुक्तो हृषीकेशो गुडाकेशेन भारत ।  
सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये स्थापयित्वा रथोत्तमम्   ॥२४॥

sañjaya uvāca  
evam ukto hṛṣīkeśo  
guḍākeśena bhārata  
senayor ubhayor madhye  
sthāpayitvā rathottamam



### Translation:

**Sanjaya said: O descendant of Bharata, having thus been addressed by Arjuna, Lord Krishna drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties.**

### Purport:

In this verse Arjuna is referred to as Gudakesa. Gudaka means sleep, and one who conquers sleep is called gudakesa. Sleep also means ignorance. So Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with Krishna. As a great devotee of Krishna, he could not forget Krishna even for a moment, because that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of Krishna's name, form, qualities and pastimes. Thus a devotee of Krishna can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking of Krishna constantly. This is called Krishna consciousness, or samadhi. As Hrishikesa, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, Krishna could understand Arjuna's purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies. Thus He did so, and spoke as follows.
