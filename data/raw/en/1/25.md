भीष्मद्रोणप्रमुखतः सर्वेषां च महीक्षिताम् ।  
उवाच पार्थ पश्यैतान्समवेतान्कुरूनिति ॥२५॥

bhīṣma-droṇa-pramukhataḥ  
sarveṣāḿ ca mahī-kṣitām  
uvāca pārtha paśyaitān  
samavetān kurūn iti



### Translation:

**In the presence of Bhishma, Drona and all the other chieftains of the world, the Lord said, Just behold, Partha, all the Kurus assembled here.**

### Purport:

As the Supersoul of all living entities, Lord Krishna could understand what was going on in the mind of Arjuna. The use of the word Hrishikesa in this connection indicates that He knew everything. And the word Partha, or the son of Kunti, or Pritha, is also similarly significant in reference to Arjuna. As a friend, He wanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of Pritha, the sister of His own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna. Now what did Krishna mean when He told Arjuna to "behold the Kurus"? Did Arjuna want to stop there and not fight? Krishna never expected such things from the son of His aunt Pritha. The mind of Arjuna was thus predicted by the Lord in friendly joking.
