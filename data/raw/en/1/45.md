यदि मामप्रतीकारमशस्त्रं शस्त्रपाणयः ।  
धार्तराष्ट्रा रणे हन्युस्तन्मे क्षेमतरं भवेत् ॥४५॥

yadi mām apratīkāram  
aśastraḿ śastra-pāṇayaḥ  
dhārtarāṣṭrā raṇe hanyus  
tan me kṣemataraḿ bhavet



### Translation:

**Better for me if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, were to kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield.**

### Purport:

It is the custom -- according to kshatriya fighting principles -- that an unarmed and unwilling foe should not be attacked. Arjuna, however, decided that even if attacked by the enemy in such an awkward position, he would not fight. He did not consider how much the other party was bent upon fighting. All these symptoms are due to soft-heartedness resulting from his being a great devotee of the Lord.
