अन्ये च बहवः शूरा मदर्थे त्यक्तजीविताः ।  
नानाशस्त्रप्रहरणाः सर्वे युद्धविशारदाः ॥९॥

anye ca bahavaḥ śūrā  
mad-arthe tyakta-jīvitāḥ  
nānā-śastra-praharaṇāḥ  
sarve yuddha-viśāradāḥ



### Translation:

**There are many other heroes who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. All of them are well equipped with different kinds of weapons, and all are experienced in military science.**

### Purport:

As far as the others are concerned -- like Jayadratha, Kritavarma and Salya -- all are determined to lay down their lives for Duryodhana's sake. In other words, it is already concluded that all of them would die in the Battle of Kurukshetra for joining the party of the sinful Duryodhana. Duryodhana was, of course, confident of his victory on account of the above-mentioned combined strength of his friends.
