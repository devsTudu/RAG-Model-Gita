तस्माद्यस्य महाबाहो निगृहीतानि सर्वशः ।  
इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥६८॥

tasmād yasya mahā-bāho  
nigṛhītāni sarvaśaḥ  
indriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas  
tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā



### Translation:

**Therefore, O mighty-armed, one whose senses are restrained from their objects is certainly of steady intelligence.**

### Purport:

One can curb the forces of sense gratification only by means of Krishna consciousness, or engaging all the senses in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As enemies are curbed by superior force, the senses can similarly be curbed, not by any human endeavor, but only by keeping them engaged in the service of the Lord. One who has understood this -- that only by Krishna consciousness is one really established in intelligence and that one should practice this art under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master -- is called sadhaka, or a suitable candidate for liberation.
