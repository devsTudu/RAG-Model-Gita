अवाच्यवादांश्च बहून्वदिष्यन्ति तवाहिताः ।  
निन्दन्तस्तव सामर्थ्यं ततो दुःखतरं नु किम् ॥३६॥

nindantas tava sāmarthyaḿ  
tato duḥkhataraḿ nu kim



### Translation:

**Your enemies will describe you in many unkind words and scorn your ability. What could be more painful for you?**

### Purport:

Lord Krishna was astonished in the beginning at Arjuna's uncalled-for plea for compassion, and He described his compassion as befitting the non-Aryans. Now in so many words, He has proved His statements against Arjuna's so-called compassion.
