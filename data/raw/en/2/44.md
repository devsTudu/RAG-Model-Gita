भोगैश्वर्यप्रसक्तानां तयापहृतचेतसाम् ।  
व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिः समाधौ न विधीयते ॥४४॥

bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāḿ  
tayāpahṛta-cetasām  
vyavasāyātmikā buddhiḥ  
samādhau na vidhīyate



### Translation:

**In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place.**

### Purport:

Samadhi means "fixed mind." The Vedic dictionary, the Nirukti, says, samyag adhiyate 'sminn atma-tattva-yathatmyam: "When the mind is fixed for understanding the self, it is said to be in samadhi. " Samadhi is never possible for persons interested in material sense enjoyment, nor for those who are bewildered by such temporary things. They are more or less condemned by the process of material energy.
