अनन्तश्चास्मि नागानां वरुणो यादसामहम् ।  
पितॄणामर्यमा चास्मि यमः संयमतामहम् ॥ २९॥

anantaś cāsmi nāgānāḿ  
varuṇo yādasām aham  
pitṝṇām aryamā cāsmi  
yamaḥ saḿyamatām aham



### Translation:

**Of the many-hooded Nagas I am Ananta, and among the aquatics I am the demigod Varuna. Of departed ancestors I am Aryama, and among the dispensers of law I am Yama, the lord of death.**

### Purport:

Among the many-hooded Naga serpents, Ananta is the greatest, as is the demigod Varuna among the aquatics. They both represent Krishna. There is also a planet of Pitas, ancestors, presided over by Aryama, who represents Krishna. There are many living entities who give punishment to the miscreants, and among them Yama is the chief. Yama is situated in a planet near this earthly planet. After death those who are very sinful are taken there, and Yama arranges different kinds of punishments for them.
