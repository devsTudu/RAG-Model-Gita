नान्तोऽस्ति मम दिव्यानां विभूतीनां परन्तप ।  
एष तूद्देशतः प्रोक्तो विभूतेर्विस्तरो मया ॥ ४०॥

nānto 'sti mama divyānāḿ  
vibhūtīnāḿ parantapa  
eṣa tūddeśataḥ prokto  
vibhūter vistaro mayā



### Translation:

**O mighty conqueror of enemies, there is no end to My divine manifestations. What I have spoken to you is but a mere indication of My infinite opulences.**

### Purport:

As stated in the Vedic literature, although the opulences and energies of the Supreme are understood in various ways, there is no limit to such opulences; therefore not all the opulences and energies can be explained. Simply a few examples are being described to Arjuna to pacify his inquisitiveness.
