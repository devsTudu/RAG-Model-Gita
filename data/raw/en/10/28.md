आयुधानामहं वज्रं धेनूनामस्मि कामधुक् ।  
प्रजनश्चास्मि कन्दर्पः सर्पाणामस्मि वासुकिः ॥२८॥

āyudhānām ahaḿ vajraḿ  
dhenūnām asmi kāmadhuk  
prajanaś cāsmi kandarpaḥ  
sarpāṇām asmi vāsukiḥ



### Translation:

**Of weapons I am the thunderbolt; among cows I am the surabhi. Of causes for procreation I am Kandarpa, the god of love, and of serpents I am Vasuki.**

### Purport:

The thunderbolt, indeed a mighty weapon, represents Krishna's power. In Krishnaloka in the spiritual sky there are cows which can be milked at any time, and they give as much milk as one likes. Of course such cows do not exist in this material world, but there is mention of them in Krishnaloka. The Lord keeps many such cows, which are called surabhi. It is stated that the Lord is engaged in herding the surabhi cows. Kandarpa is the sex desire for presenting good sons; therefore Kandarpa is the representative of Krishna. Sometimes sex is engaged in only for sense gratification; such sex does not represent Krishna. But sex for the generation of good children is called Kandarpa and represents Krishna.
