पश्यादित्यान्वसून्रुद्रानश्विनौ मरुतस्तथा ।  
बहून्यदृष्टपूर्वाणि पश्याश्चर्याणि भारत ॥ ६॥

paśyādityān vasūn rudrān  
aśvinau marutas tathā  
bahūny adṛṣṭa-pūrvāṇi  
paśyāścaryāṇi bhārata



### Translation:

**O best of the Bharatas, see here the different manifestations of Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Asvini-kumaras and all the other demigods. Behold the many wonderful things which no one has ever seen or heard of before.**

### Purport:

Even though Arjuna was a personal friend of Krishna and the most advanced of learned men, it was still not possible for him to know everything about Krishna. Here it is stated that humans have neither heard nor known of all these forms and manifestations. Now Krishna reveals these wonderful forms.
