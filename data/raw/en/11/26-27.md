### Translation:

**All the sons of Dhritarashtra, along with their allied kings, and Bhishma, Drona, Karna -- and our chief soldiers also -- are rushing into Your fearful mouths. And some I see trapped with heads smashed between Your teeth.**

### Purport:

In a previous verse the Lord promised to show Arjuna things he would be very interested in seeing. Now Arjuna sees that the leaders of the opposite party (Bhishma, Drona, Karna and all the sons of Dhritarashtra) and their soldiers and Arjuna's own soldiers are all being annihilated. This is an indication that after the death of nearly all the persons assembled at Kurukshetra, Arjuna will emerge victorious. It is also mentioned here that Bhishma, who is supposed to be unconquerable, will also be smashed. So also Karna. Not only will the great warriors of the other party like Bhishma be smashed, but some of the great warriors of Arjuna's side also.
