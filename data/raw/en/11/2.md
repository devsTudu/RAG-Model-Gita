भवाप्ययौ हि भूतानां श्रुतौ विस्तरशो मया ।  
त्वत्तः कमलपत्राक्ष माहात्म्यमपि चाव्ययम् ॥२॥

bhavāpyayau hi bhūtānāḿ  
śrutau vistaraśo mayā  
tvattaḥ kamala-patrākṣa  
māhātmyam api cāvyayam



### Translation:

**O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and disappearance of every living entity and have realized Your inexhaustible glories.**

### Purport:

Arjuna addresses Lord Krishna as "lotus-eyed" (Krishna's eyes appear just like the petals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for Krishna has assured him, in the previous chapter, aham kritsnasya jagatah prabhavah pralayas tatha: "I am the source of the appearance and disappearance of this entire material manifestation." Arjuna has heard of this from the Lord in detail. Arjuna further knows that in spite of His being the source of all appearances and disappearances, He is aloof from them. As the Lord has said in the Ninth Chapter, He is all-pervading, yet He is not personally present everywhere. That is the inconceivable opulence of Krishna which Arjuna admits that he has thoroughly understood.
