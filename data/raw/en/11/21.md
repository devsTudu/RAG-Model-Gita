अमी हि त्वां सुरसंघा विशन्ति  
केचिद्भीताः प्राञ्जलयो गृणन्ति ।  
स्वस्तीत्युक्त्वा महर्षिसिद्धसंघाः  
स्तुवन्ति त्वां स्तुतिभिः पुष्कलाभिः ॥२१॥

amī hi tvāḿ sura-sańghā viśanti  
kecid bhītāḥ prāñjalayo gṛṇanti  
svastīty uktvā maharṣi-siddha-sańghāḥ  
stuvanti tvāḿ stutibhiḥ puṣkalābhiḥ



### Translation:

**All the hosts of demigods are surrendering before You and entering into You. Some of them, very much afraid, are offering prayers with folded hands. Hosts of great sages and perfected beings, crying "All peace!" are praying to You by singing the Vedic hymns.**

### Purport:

The demigods in all the planetary systems feared the terrific manifestation of the universal form and its glaring effulgence and so prayed for protection.
