अनादिमध्यान्तमनन्तवीर्य-  
मनन्तबाहुं शशिसूर्यनेत्रम् ।  
पश्यामि त्वां दीप्तहुताशवक्त्रं  
स्वतेजसा विश्वमिदं तपन्तम् ॥१९॥

anādi-madhyāntam ananta-vīryam  
ananta-bāhuḿ śaśi-sūrya-netram  
paśyāmi tvāḿ dīpta-hutāśa-vaktraḿ  
sva-tejasā viśvam idaḿ tapantam



### Translation:

**You are without origin, middle or end. Your glory is unlimited. You have numberless arms, and the sun and moon are Your eyes. I see You with blazing fire coming forth from Your mouth, burning this entire universe by Your own radiance.**

### Purport:

There is no limit to the extent of the six opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here and in many other places there is repetition, but according to the scriptures, repetition of the glories of Krishna is not a literary weakness. It is said that at a time of bewilderment or wonder or of great ecstasy, statements are repeated over and over. That is not a flaw.
