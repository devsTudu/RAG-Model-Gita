नाहं वेदैर्न तपसा न दानेन न चेज्यया ।  
शक्य एवंविधो द्रष्टुं दृष्टवानसि मां यथा ॥५३॥

nāhaḿ vedair na tapasā  
na dānena na cejyayā  
śakya evaḿ-vidho draṣṭuḿ  
dṛṣṭavān asi māḿ yathā



### Translation:

**The form you are seeing with your transcendental eyes cannot be understood simply by studying the Vedas, nor by undergoing serious penances, nor by charity, nor by worship. It is not by these means that one can see Me as I am.**

### Purport:

Krishna first appeared before His parents Devaki and Vasudeva in a four-handed form, and then He transformed Himself into the two-handed form. This mystery is very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of devotional service. For scholars who have simply studied Vedic literature by way of grammatical knowledge or mere academic qualifications, Krishna is not possible to understand. Nor is He to be understood by persons who officially go to the temple to offer worship. They make their visit, but they cannot understand Krishna as He is. Krishna can be understood only through the path of devotional service, as explained by Krishna Himself in the next verse.
