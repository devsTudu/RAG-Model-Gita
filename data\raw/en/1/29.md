वेपथुश्च शरीरे मे रोमहर्षश्च जायते ।  
गाण्डीवं स्रंसते हस्तात्त्वक्चैव परिदह्यते ॥२९॥

vepathuś ca śarīre me  
roma-harṣaś ca jāyate  
gāṇḍīvaḿ sraḿsate hastāt  
tvak caiva paridahyate



### Translation:

**My whole body is trembling, my hair is standing on end, my bow Gandiva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning.**

### Purport:

There are two kinds of trembling of the body, and two kinds of standings of the hair on end. Such phenomena occur either in great spiritual ecstasy or out of great fear under material conditions. There is no fear in transcendental realization. Arjuna's symptoms in this situation are out of material fear -- namely, loss of life. This is evident from other symptoms also; he became so impatient that his famous bow Gandiva was slipping from his hands, and, because his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation of the skin. All these are due to a material conception of life.
