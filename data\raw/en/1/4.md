अत्र शूरा महेष्वासा भीमार्जुनसमा युधि ।  
युयुधानो विराटश्च द्रुपदश्च महारथः ॥४॥

atra śūrā maheṣv-āsā  
bhīmārjuna-samā yudhi  
yuyudhāno virāṭaś ca  
drupadaś ca mahā-rathaḥ



### Translation:

**Here in this army are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bhima and Arjuna: great fighters like Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada.**

### Purport:

Even though Dhrishtadyumna was not a very important obstacle in the face of Dronacarya's very great power in the military art, there were many others who were causes of fear. They are mentioned by Duryodhana as great stumbling blocks on the path of victory because each and every one of them was as formidable as Bhima and Arjuna. He knew the strength of Bhima and Arjuna, and thus he compared the others with them.
