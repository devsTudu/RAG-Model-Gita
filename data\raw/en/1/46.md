सञ्जय उवाच  
एवमुक्त्वार्जुनः संख्ये रथोपस्थ उपाविशत् ।  
विसृज्य सशरं चापं शोकसंविग्नमानसः ॥४६॥

sañjaya uvāca  
evam uktvārjunaḥ sańkhye  
rathopastha upāviśat  
visṛjya sa-śaraḿ cāpaḿ  
śoka-saḿvigna-mānasaḥ



### Translation:

**Sanjaya said: Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief.**

### Purport:

While observing the situation of his enemy, Arjuna stood up on the chariot, but he was so afflicted with lamentation that he sat down again, setting aside his bow and arrows. Such a kind and soft-hearted person, in the devotional service of the Lord, is fit to receive self-knowledge.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the First Chapter of the Srimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kurukshetra.
