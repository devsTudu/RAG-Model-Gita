अनन्तविजयं राजा कुन्तीपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः ।  
नकुलः सहदेवश्च सुघोषमणिपुष्पकौ ॥१६॥  
काश्यश्च परमेष्वासः शिखण्डी च महारथः ।  
धृष्टद्युम्नो विराटश्च सात्यकिश्चापराजितः ॥१७॥  
द्रुपदो द्रौपदेयाश्च सर्वशः पृथिवीपते ।  
सौभद्रश्च महाबाहुः शङ्खान्दध्मुः पृथक्पृथक् ॥१८॥

### Translation:

**King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conchshell, the Ananta-vijaya, and Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosha and Manipushpaka. That great archer the King of Kasi, the great fighter Sikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, the unconquerable Satyaki, Drupada, the sons of Draupadi, and the others, O King, such as the mighty-armed son of Subhadra, all blew their respective conchshells.**

### Purport:

Sanjaya informed King Dhritarashtra very tactfully that his unwise policy of deceiving the sons of Pandu and endeavoring to enthrone his own sons on the seat of the kingdom was not very laudable. The signs already clearly indicated that the whole Kuru dynasty would be killed in that great battle. Beginning with the grandsire, Bhishma, down to the grandsons like Abhimanyu and others -- including kings from many states of the world -- all were present there, and all were doomed. The whole catastrophe was due to King Dhritarashtra, because he encouraged the policy followed by his sons.
