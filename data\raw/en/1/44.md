अहो बत महत्पापं कर्तुं व्यवसिता वयम् ।  
यद्राज्यसुखलोभेन हन्तुं स्वजनमुद्यताः ॥४४॥

aho bata mahat pāpaḿ  
kartuḿ vyavasitā vayam  
yad rājya-sukha-lobhena  
hantuḿ sva-janam udyatāḥ



### Translation:

**Alas, how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful acts. Driven by the desire to enjoy royal happiness, we are intent on killing our own kinsmen.**

### Purport:

Driven by selfish motives, one may be inclined to such sinful acts as the killing of one's own brother, father or mother. There are many such instances in the history of the world. But Arjuna, being a saintly devotee of the Lord, is always conscious of moral principles and therefore takes care to avoid such activities.
