स घोषो धार्तराष्ट्राणां हृदयानि व्यदारयत् ।  
नभश्च पृथिवीं चैव तुमुलोऽभ्यनुनादयन् ॥१९॥

sa ghoṣo dhārtarāṣṭrāṇāḿ  
hṛdayāni vyadārayat  
nabhaś ca pṛthivīḿ caiva  
tumulo 'bhyanunādayan



### Translation:

**The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious. Vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra.**

### Purport:

When Bhishma and the others on the side of Duryodhana blew their respective conchshells, there was no heart-breaking on the part of the Pandavas. Such occurrences are not mentioned, but in this particular verse it is mentioned that the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra were shattered by the sounds vibrated by the Pandavas' party. This is due to the Pandavas and their confidence in Lord Krishna. One who takes shelter of the Supreme Lord has nothing to fear, even in the midst of the greatest calamity.
