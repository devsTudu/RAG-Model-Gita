योत्स्यमानानवेक्षेऽहं य एतेऽत्र समागताः ।  
धार्तराष्ट्रस्य दुर्बुद्धेर्युद्धे प्रियचिकीर्षवः ॥२३॥

yotsyamānān avekṣe 'haḿ  
ya ete 'tra samāgatāḥ  
dhārtarāṣṭrasya durbuddher  
yuddhe priya-cikīrṣavaḥ



### Translation:

**Let me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.**

### Purport:

It was an open secret that Duryodhana wanted to usurp the kingdom of the Pandavas by evil plans, in collaboration with his father, Dhritarashtra. Therefore, all persons who had joined the side of Duryodhana must have been birds of the same feather. Arjuna wanted to see them on the battlefield before the fight was begun, just to learn who they were, but he had no intention of proposing peace negotiations with them. It was also a fact that he wanted to see them to make an estimate of the strength which he had to face, although he was quite confident of victory because Krishna was sitting by his side.
