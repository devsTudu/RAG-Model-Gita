भवान्भीष्मश्च कर्णश्च कृपश्च समितिंजयः ।  
अश्वत्थामा विकर्णश्च सौमदत्तिस्तथैव च ॥८॥

bhavān bhīṣmaś ca karṇaś ca  
kṛpaś ca samitiḿ-jayaḥ  
aśvatthāmā vikarṇaś ca  
saumadattis tathaiva ca



### Translation:

**There are personalities like you, Bhishma, Karna, Kripa, Asvatthama, Vikarna and the son of Somadatta called Bhurisrava, who are always victorious in battle.**

### Purport:

Duryodhana mentions the exceptional heroes in the battle, all of whom are ever victorious. Vikarna is the brother of Duryodhana, Asvatthama is the son of Dronacarya, and Saumadatti, or Bhurisrava, is the son of the King of the Bahlikas. Karna is the half brother of Arjuna, as he was born of Kunti before her marriage with King Pandu. Kripacarya's twin sister married Dronacarya.
