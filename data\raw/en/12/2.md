श्रीभगवानुवाच  
मय्यावेश्य मनो ये मां नित्ययुक्ता उपासते ।  
श्रद्धया परयोपेतास्ते मे युक्ततमा मताः ॥२॥

śrī-bhagavān uvāca  
mayy āveśya mano ye māḿ  
nitya-yuktā upāsate  
śraddhayā parayopetās  
te me yuktatamā matāḥ



### Translation:

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Those who fix their minds on My personal form and are always engaged in worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith are considered by Me to be most perfect.**

### Purport:

In answer to Arjuna's question, Krishna clearly says that he who concentrates upon His personal form and who worships Him with faith and devotion is to be considered most perfect in yoga. For one in such Krishna consciousness there are no material activities, because everything is done for Krishna. A pure devotee is constantly engaged. Sometimes he chants, sometimes he hears or reads books about Krishna, or sometimes he cooks prasadam or goes to the marketplace to purchase something for Krishna, or sometimes he washes the temple or the dishes -- whatever he does, he does not let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to Krishna. Such action is in full samadhi.
