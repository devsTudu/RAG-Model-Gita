ये चैव सात्त्विका भावा राजसास्तामसाश्च ये ।  
मत्त एवेति तान्विद्धि न त्वहं तेषु ते मयि ॥१२॥

ye caiva sāttvikā bhāvā  
rājasās tāmasāś ca ye  
matta eveti tān viddhi  
na tv ahaḿ teṣu te mayi



### Translation:

**Know that all states of being -- be they of goodness, passion or ignorance -- are manifested by My energy. I am, in one sense, everything, but I am independent. I am not under the modes of material nature, for they, on the contrary, are within Me.**

### Purport:

All material activities in the world are being conducted under the three modes of material nature. Although these material modes of nature are emanations from the Supreme Lord, Krishna, He is not subject to them. For instance, under the state laws one may be punished, but the king, the lawmaker, is not subject to that law. Similarly, all the modes of material nature -- goodness, passion and ignorance -- are emanations from the Supreme Lord, Krishna, but Krishna is not subject to material nature. Therefore He is nirguna, which means that these gunas, or modes, although issuing from Him, do not affect Him. That is one of the special characteristics of Bhagavan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
