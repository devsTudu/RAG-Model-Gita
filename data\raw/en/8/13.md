ओमित्येकाक्षरं ब्रह्म व्याहरन्मामनुस्मरन्। >  
यः प्रयाति त्यजन्देहं स याति परमां गतिम्॥८- १३॥

oḿ ity ekākṣaraḿ brahma  
vyāharan mām anusmaran  
yaḥ prayāti tyajan dehaḿ  
sa yāti paramāḿ gatim



### Translation:

**After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable om, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.**

### Purport:

It is clearly stated here that om, Brahman and Lord Krishna are not different. The impersonal sound of Krishna is om, but the sound Hare Krishna contains om. The chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra is clearly recommended for this age. So if one quits his body at the end of life chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, he certainly reaches one of the spiritual planets, according to the mode of his practice. The devotees of Krishna enter the Krishna planet, Goloka Vrindavana. For the personalists there are also innumerable other planets, known as Vaikuntha planets, in the spiritual sky, whereas the impersonalists remain in the brahmajyoti.
