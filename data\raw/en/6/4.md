यदा हि नेन्द्रियार्थेषु न कर्मस्वनुषज्जते ।  
सर्वसंकल्पसंन्यासी योगारूढस्तदोच्यते ॥४॥

yadā hi nendriyārtheṣu  
na karmasv anuṣajjate  
sarva-sańkalpa-sannyāsī  
yogārūḍhas tadocyate



### Translation:

**A person is said to be elevated in yoga when, having renounced all material desires, he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive activities.**

### Purport:

When a person is fully engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he is pleased in himself, and thus he is no longer engaged in sense gratification or in fruitive activities. Otherwise, one must be engaged in sense gratification, since one cannot live without engagement. Without Krishna consciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended selfish activities. But a Krishna conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction of Krishna and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification. One who has no such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before being elevated to the top rung of the yoga ladder.
