एतन्मे संशयं कृष्ण छेत्तुमर्हस्यशेषतः ।  
त्वदन्यः संशयस्यास्य छेत्ता न ह्युपपद्यते ॥३९॥

etan me saḿśayaḿ kṛṣṇa  
chettum arhasy aśeṣataḥ  
tvad-anyaḥ saḿśayasyāsya  
chettā na hy upapadyate



### Translation:

**This is my doubt, O Krishna, and I ask You to dispel it completely. But for You, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt.**

### Purport:

Krishna is the perfect knower of past, present and future. In the beginning of the Bhagavad-gita, the Lord said that all living entities existed individually in the past, they exist now in the present, and they continue to retain individual identity in the future, even after liberation from the material entanglement. So He has already cleared up the question of the future of the individual living entity. Now, Arjuna wants to know of the future of the unsuccessful transcendentalist. No one is equal to or above Krishna, and certainly the so-called great sages and philosophers who are at the mercy of material nature cannot equal Him. Therefore the verdict of Krishna is the final and complete answer to all doubts, because He knows past, present and future perfectly -- but no one knows Him. Krishna and Krishna conscious devotees alone can know what is what.
