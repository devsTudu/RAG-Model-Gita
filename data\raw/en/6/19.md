यथा दीपो निवातस्थो नेङ्गते सोपमा स्मृता ।  
योगिनो यतचित्तस्य युञ्जतो योगमात्मनः ॥१९॥

yathā dīpo nivāta-stho  
neńgate sopamā smṛtā  
yogino yata-cittasya  
yuñjato yogam ātmanaḥ



### Translation:

**As a lamp in a windless place does not waver, so the transcendentalist, whose mind is controlled, remains always steady in his meditation on the transcendent self.**

### Purport:

A truly Krishna conscious person, always absorbed in transcendence, in constant undisturbed meditation on his worshipable Lord, is as steady as a lamp in a windless place.
