युञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी विगतकल्मषः ।  
सुखेन ब्रह्मसंस्पर्शमत्यन्तं सुखमश्नुते ॥२८॥

yuñjann evaḿ sadātmānaḿ  
yogī vigata-kalmaṣaḥ  
sukhena brahma-saḿsparśam  
atyantaḿ sukham aśnute



### Translation:

**Thus the self-controlled yogi, constantly engaged in yoga practice, becomes free from all material contamination and achieves the highest stage of perfect happiness in transcendental loving service to the Lord.**

### Purport:

Self-realization means knowing one's constitutional position in relationship to the Supreme. The individual soul is part and parcel of the Supreme, and his position is to render transcendental service to the Lord. This transcendental contact with the Supreme is called brahma-samsparsa.
