योगसंन्यस्तकर्माणं ज्ञानसंछिन्नसंशयम् ।  
आत्मवन्तं न कर्माणि निबध्नन्ति धनंजय ॥४१॥

yoga-sannyasta-karmāṇaḿ  
jñāna-sañchinna-saḿśayam  
ātmavantaḿ na karmāṇi  
nibadhnanti dhanañjaya



### Translation:

**One who acts in devotional service, renouncing the fruits of his actions, and whose doubts have been destroyed by transcendental knowledge, is situated factually in the self. Thus he is not bound by the reactions of work, O conqueror of riches.**

### Purport:

One who follows the instruction of the Bhagavad-gita, as it is imparted by the Lord, the Personality of Godhead Himself, becomes free from all doubts by the grace of transcendental knowledge. He, as a part and parcel of the Lord, in full Krishna consciousness, is already established in self-knowledge. As such, he is undoubtedly above bondage to action.
