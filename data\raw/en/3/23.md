यदि ह्यहं न वर्तेयं जातु कर्मण्यतन्द्रितः ।  
मम वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थ सर्वशः ॥२३॥

yadi hy ahaḿ na varteyaḿ  
jātu karmaṇy atandritaḥ  
mama vartmānuvartante  
manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ



### Translation:

**For if I ever failed to engage in carefully performing prescribed duties, O Partha, certainly all men would follow My path.**

### Purport:

In order to keep the balance of social tranquillity for progress in spiritual life, there are traditional family usages meant for every civilized man. Although such rules and regulations are for the conditioned souls and not Lord Krishna, because He descended to establish the principles of religion He followed the prescribed rules. Otherwise, common men would follow in His footsteps, because He is the greatest authority. From the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is understood that Lord Krishna was performing all the religious duties at home and out of home, as required of a householder.
