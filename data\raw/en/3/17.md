यस्त्वात्मरतिरेव स्यादात्मतृप्तश्च मानवः ।  
आत्मन्येव च सन्तुष्टस्तस्य कार्यं न विद्यते ॥१७॥

yas tv ātma-ratir eva syād  
ātma-tṛptaś ca mānavaḥ  
ātmany eva ca santuṣṭas  
tasya kāryaḿ na vidyate



### Translation:

**But for one who takes pleasure in the self, whose human life is one of self-realization, and who is satisfied in the self only, fully satiated -- for him there is no duty.**

### Purport:

A person who is fully Krishna conscious, and is fully satisfied by his acts in Krishna consciousness, no longer has any duty to perform. Due to his being Krishna conscious, all impiety within is instantly cleansed, an effect of many, many thousands of yajna performances. By such clearing of consciousness, one becomes fully confident of his eternal position in relationship with the Supreme. His duty thus becomes self-illuminated by the grace of the Lord, and therefore he no longer has any obligations to the Vedic injunctions. Such a Krishna conscious person is no longer interested in material activities and no longer takes pleasure in material arrangements like wine, women and similar infatuations.
