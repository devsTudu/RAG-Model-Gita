ये त्वेतदभ्यसूयन्तो नानुतिष्ठन्ति मे मतम् ।  
सर्वज्ञानविमूढांस्तान्विद्धि नष्टानचेतसः ॥३२॥

ye tv etad abhyasūyanto  
nānutiṣṭhanti me matam  
sarva-jñāna-vimūḍhāḿs tān  
viddhi naṣṭān acetasaḥ



### Translation:

**But those who, out of envy, disregard these teachings and do not follow them are to be considered bereft of all knowledge, befooled, and ruined in their endeavors for perfection.**

### Purport:

The flaw of not being Krishna conscious is clearly stated herein. As there is punishment for disobedience to the order of the supreme executive head, so there is certainly punishment for disobedience to the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A disobedient person, however great he may be, is ignorant of his own self, and of the Supreme Brahman, Paramatma and the Personality of Godhead, due to a vacant heart. Therefore there is no hope of perfection of life for him.
