पुरोधसां च मुख्यं मां विद्धि पार्थ बृहस्पतिम् ।  
सेनानीनामहं स्कन्दः सरसामस्मि सागरः ॥२४॥

purodhasāḿ ca mukhyaḿ māḿ  
viddhi pārtha bṛhaspatim  
senānīnām ahaḿ skandaḥ  
sarasām asmi sāgaraḥ



### Translation:

**Of priests, O Arjuna, know Me to be the chief, Brihaspati. Of generals I am Kartikeya, and of bodies of water I am the ocean.**

### Purport:

Indra is the chief demigod of the heavenly planets and is known as the king of the heavens. The planet on which he reigns is called Indraloka. Brihaspati is Indra's priest, and since Indra is the chief of all kings, Brihaspati is the chief of all priests. And as Indra is the chief of all kings, similarly Skanda, or Kartikeya, the son of Parvati and Lord Siva, is the chief of all military commanders. And of all bodies of water, the ocean is the greatest. These representations of Krishna only give hints of His greatness.
