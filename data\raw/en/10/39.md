# Text 39

यच्चापि सर्वभूतानां बीजं तदहमर्जुन ।  
न तदस्ति विना यत्स्यान्मया भूतं चराचरम् ॥३९॥

yac cāpi sarva-bhūtānāḿ  
bījaḿ tad aham arjuna  
na tad asti vinā yat syān  
mayā bhūtaḿ carācaram



### Translation:

**Furthermore, O Arjuna, I am the generating seed of all existences. There is no being -- moving or nonmoving -- that can exist without Me.**

### Purport:

Everything has a cause, and that cause or seed of manifestation is Krishna. Without Krishna's energy, nothing can exist; therefore He is called omnipotent. Without His potency, neither the movable nor the immovable can exist. Whatever existence is not founded on the energy of Krishna is called maya, "that which is not."
