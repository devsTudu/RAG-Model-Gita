अर्जुन उवाच  
स्थितप्रज्ञस्य का भाषा समाधिस्थस्य केशव ।  
स्थितधीः किं प्रभाषेत किमासीत व्रजेत किम् ॥५४॥

arjuna uvāca  
sthita-prajñasya kā bhāṣā  
samādhi-sthasya keśava  
sthita-dhīḥ kiḿ prabhāṣeta  
kim āsīta vrajeta kim



### Translation:

**Arjuna said: O Krishna, what are the symptoms of one whose consciousness is thus merged in transcendence? How does he speak, and what is his language? How does he sit, and how does he walk?**

### Purport:

As there are symptoms for each and every man, in terms of his particular situation, similarly one who is Krishna conscious has his particular nature -- talking, walking, thinking, feeling, etc. As a rich man has his symptoms by which he is known as a rich man, as a diseased man has his symptoms by which he is known as diseased, or as a learned man has his symptoms, so a man in transcendental consciousness of Krishna has specific symptoms in various dealings. One can know his specific symptoms from the Bhagavad-gita. Most important is how the man in Krishna consciousness speaks; for speech is the most important quality of any man. It is said that a fool is undiscovered as long as he does not speak, and certainly a well-dressed fool cannot be identified unless he speaks, but as soon as he speaks, he reveals himself at once. The immediate symptom of a Krishna conscious man is that he speaks only of Krishna and of matters relating to Him. Other symptoms then automatically follow, as stated below.
