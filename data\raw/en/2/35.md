भयाद्रणादुपरतं मंस्यन्ते त्वां महारथाः ।  
येषां च त्वं बहुमतो भूत्वा यास्यसि लाघवम् ॥३५॥

bhayād raṇād uparataḿ  
maḿsyante tvāḿ mahā-rathāḥ  
yeṣāḿ ca tvaḿ bahu-mato  
bhūtvā yāsyasi lāghavam



### Translation:

**The great generals who have highly esteemed your name and fame will think that you have left the battlefield out of fear only, and thus they will consider you insignificant.**

### Purport:

Lord Krishna continued to give His verdict to Arjuna: "Do not think that the great generals like Duryodhana, Karna, and other contemporaries will think that you have left the battlefield out of compassion for your brothers and grandfather. They will think that you have left out of fear for your life. And thus their high estimation of your personality will go to hell."
