देही नित्यमवध्योऽयं देहे सर्वस्य भारत ।  
तस्मात्सर्वाणि भूतानि न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥३०॥

dehī nityam avadhyo 'yaḿ  
dehe sarvasya bhārata  
tasmāt sarvāṇi bhūtāni  
na tvaḿ śocitum arhasi



### Translation:

**O descendant of Bharata, he who dwells in the body can never be slain. Therefore you need not grieve for any living being.**

### Purport:

The Lord now concludes the chapter of instruction on the immutable spirit soul. In describing the immortal soul in various ways, Lord Krishna establishes that the soul is immortal and the body is temporary. Therefore Arjuna as a kshatriya should not abandon his duty out of fear that his grandfather and teacher -- Bhishma and Drona -- will die in the battle. On the authority of Sri Krishna, one has to believe that there is a soul different from the material body, not that there is no such thing as soul, or that living symptoms develop at a certain stage of material maturity resulting from the interaction of chemicals. Though the soul is immortal, violence is not encouraged, but at the time of war it is not discouraged when there is actual need for it. That need must be justified in terms of the sanction of the Lord, and not capriciously.
