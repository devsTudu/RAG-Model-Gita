अर्जुन उवाच  
कथं भीष्ममहं संख्ये द्रोणं च मधुसूदन ।  
इषुभिः प्रतियोत्स्यामि पूजार्हावरिसूदन ॥४॥

arjuna uvāca  
kathaḿ bhīṣmam ahaḿ sańkhye  
droṇaḿ ca madhusūdana  
iṣubhiḥ pratiyotsyāmi  
pūjārhāv ari-sūdana



### Translation:

**Arjuna said: O killer of enemies, O killer of Madhu, how can I counterattack with arrows in battle men like Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of my worship?**

### Purport:

Respectable superiors like Bhishma the grandfather and Dronacarya the teacher are always worshipable. Even if they attack, they should not be counterattacked. It is general etiquette that superiors are not to be offered even a verbal fight. Even if they are sometimes harsh in behavior, they should not be harshly treated. Then, how is it possible for Arjuna to counterattack them? Would Krishna ever attack His own grandfather, Ugrasena, or His teacher, Sandipani Muni? These were some of the arguments offered by Arjuna to Krishna.
