संजय उवाच  
इत्यहं वासुदेवस्य पार्थस्य च महात्मनः ।  
संवादमिममश्रौषमद्भुतं रोमहर्षणम् ॥७४॥

sañjaya uvāca  
ity ahaḿ vāsudevasya  
pārthasya ca mahātmanaḥ  
saḿvādam imam aśrauṣam  
adbhutaḿ roma-harṣaṇam



### Translation:

**Sanjaya said: Thus have I heard the conversation of two great souls, Krishna and Arjuna. And so wonderful is that message that my hair is standing on end.**

### Purport:

In the beginning of Bhagavad-gita, Dhritarashtra inquired from his secretary Sanjaya, "What happened on the Battlefield of Kurukshetra?" The entire study was related to the heart of Sanjaya by the grace of his spiritual master, Vyasa. He thus explained the theme of the battlefield. The conversation was wonderful because such an important conversation between two great souls had never taken place before and would not take place again. It was wonderful because the Supreme Personality of Godhead was speaking about Himself and His energies to the living entity, Arjuna, a great devotee of the Lord. If we follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Krishna, then our life will be happy and successful. Sanjaya realized this, and as he began to understand it, he related the conversation to Dhritarashtra. Now it is concluded that wherever there is Krishna and Arjuna, there is victory.
