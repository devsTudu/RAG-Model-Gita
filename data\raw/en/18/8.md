दुःखमित्येव यत्कर्म कायक्लेशभयात्त्यजेत् ।  
स कृत्वा राजसं त्यागं नैव त्यागफलं लभेत् ॥८॥

duḥkham ity eva yat karma  
kāya-kleśa-bhayāt tyajet  
sa kṛtvā rājasaḿ tyāgaḿ  
naiva tyāga-phalaḿ labhet



### Translation:

**Anyone who gives up prescribed duties as troublesome or out of fear of bodily discomfort is said to have renounced in the mode of passion. Such action never leads to the elevation of renunciation.**

### Purport:

One who is in Krishna consciousness should not give up earning money out of fear that he is performing fruitive activities. If by working one can engage his money in Krishna consciousness, or if by rising early in the morning one can advance his transcendental Krishna consciousness, one should not desist out of fear or because such activities are considered troublesome. Such renunciation is in the mode of passion. The result of passionate work is always miserable. If a person renounces work in that spirit, he never gets the result of renunciation.
