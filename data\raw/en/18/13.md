पञ्चैतानि महाबाहो कारणानि निबोध मे ।  
सांख्ये कृतान्ते प्रोक्तानि सिद्धये सर्वकर्मणाम् ॥१३॥

pañcaitāni mahā-bāho  
kāraṇāni nibodha me  
sāńkhye kṛtānte proktāni  
siddhaye sarva-karmaṇām



### Translation:

**O mighty-armed Arjuna, according to the Vedanta there are five causes for the accomplishment of all action. Now learn of these from Me.**

### Purport:

A question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some reaction, how is it that the person in Krishna consciousness does not suffer or enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing Vedanta philosophy to show how this is possible. He says that there are five causes for all activities, and for success in all activity one should consider these five causes. Sankhya means the stalk of knowledge, and Vedanta is the final stalk of knowledge accepted by all leading acaryas. Even Sankara accepts Vedanta-sutra as such. Therefore such authority should be consulted.

The ultimate control is invested in the Supersoul. As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, sarvasya caham hridi sannivishtah. He is engaging everyone in certain activities by reminding him of his past actions. And Krishna conscious acts done under His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life or in the life after death.
