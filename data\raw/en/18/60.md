स्वभावजेन कौन्तेय निबद्धः स्वेन कर्मणा ।  
कर्तुं नेच्छसि यन्मोहात्करिष्यस्यवशोऽपि तत् ॥६०॥

svabhāva-jena kaunteya  
nibaddhaḥ svena karmaṇā  
kartuḿ necchasi yan mohāt  
kariṣyasy avaśo 'pi tat



### Translation:

**Under illusion you are now declining to act according to My direction. But, compelled by the work born of your own nature, you will act all the same, O son of Kunti.**

### Purport:

If one refuses to act under the direction of the Supreme Lord, then he is compelled to act by the modes in which he is situated. Everyone is under the spell of a particular combination of the modes of nature and is acting in that way. But anyone who voluntarily engages himself under the direction of the Supreme Lord becomes glorious.
