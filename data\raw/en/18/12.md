अनिष्टमिष्टं मिश्रं च त्रिविधं कर्मणः फलम् ।  
भवत्यत्यागिनां प्रेत्य न तु संन्यासिनां क्वचित् ॥१२॥

aniṣṭam iṣṭaḿ miśraḿ ca  
tri-vidhaḿ karmaṇaḥ phalam  
bhavaty atyāgināḿ pretya  
na tu sannyāsināḿ kvacit



### Translation:

**For one who is not renounced, the threefold fruits of action -- desirable, undesirable and mixed -- accrue after death. But those who are in the renounced order of life have no such result to suffer or enjoy.**

### Purport:

A person in Krishna consciousness acting in knowledge of his relationship with Krishna is always liberated. Therefore he does not have to enjoy or suffer the results of his acts after death.
