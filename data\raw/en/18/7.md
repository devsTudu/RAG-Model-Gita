नियतस्य तु संन्यासः कर्मणो नोपपद्यते ।  
मोहात्तस्य परित्यागस्तामसः परिकीर्तितः ॥७॥

niyatasya tu sannyāsaḥ  
karmaṇo nopapadyate  
mohāt tasya parityāgas  
tāmasaḥ parikīrtitaḥ



### Translation:

**Prescribed duties should never be renounced. If one gives up his prescribed duties because of illusion, such renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance.**

### Purport:

Work for material satisfaction must be given up, but activities which promote one to spiritual activity, like cooking for the Supreme Lord and offering the food to the Lord and then accepting the food, are recommended. It is said that a person in the renounced order of life should not cook for himself. Cooking for oneself is prohibited, but cooking for the Supreme Lord is not prohibited. Similarly, a sannyasi may perform a marriage ceremony to help his disciple in the advancement of Krishna consciousness. If one renounces such activities, it is to be understood that he is acting in the mode of darkness.
