कच्चिदेतच्छ्रुतं पार्थ त्वयैकाग्रेण चेतसा ।  
कच्चिदज्ञानसंमोहः प्रनष्टस्ते धनंजय ॥७२॥

kaccid etac chrutaḿ pārtha  
tvayaikāgreṇa cetasā  
kaccid ajñāna-sammohaḥ  
praṇaṣṭas te dhanañjaya



### Translation:

**O son of Pritha, O conqueror of wealth, have you heard this with an attentive mind? And are your ignorance and illusions now dispelled?**

### Purport:

The Lord was acting as the spiritual master of Arjuna. Therefore it was His duty to inquire from Arjuna whether he understood the whole Bhagavad-gita in its proper perspective. If not, the Lord was ready to re-explain any point, or the whole Bhagavad-gita if so required. Actually, anyone who hears Bhagavad-gita from a bona fide spiritual master like Krishna or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled. Bhagavad-gita is not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer; it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Any person fortunate enough to hear these teachings from Krishna or from His bona fide spiritual representative is sure to become a liberated person and get out of the darkness of ignorance.
