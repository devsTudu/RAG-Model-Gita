# Text 15

शरीरवाङ्‌मनोभिर्यत्कर्म प्रारभते नरः ।  
न्याय्यं वा विपरीतं वा पञ्चैते तस्य हेतवः ॥१५॥

śarīra-vāń-manobhir yat  
karma prārabhate naraḥ  
nyāyyaḿ vā viparītaḿ vā  
pañcaite tasya hetavaḥ



### Translation:

**Whatever right or wrong action a man performs by body, mind or speech is caused by these five factors.**

### Purport:

The words "right" and "wrong" are very significant in this verse. Right work is work done in terms of the prescribed directions in the scriptures, and wrong work is work done against the principles of the scriptural injunctions. But whatever is done requires these five factors for its complete performance.
