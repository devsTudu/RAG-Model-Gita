कार्यमित्येव यत्कर्म नियतं क्रियतेऽर्जुन ।  
सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा फलं चैव स त्यागः सात्त्विको मतः ॥९॥

kāryam ity eva yat karma  
niyataḿ kriyate 'rjuna  
sańgaḿ tyaktvā phalaḿ caiva  
sa tyāgaḥ sāttviko mataḥ



### Translation:

**O Arjuna, when one performs his prescribed duty only because it ought to be done, and renounces all material association and all attachment to the fruit, his renunciation is said to be in the mode of goodness.**

### Purport:

Prescribed duties must be performed with this mentality. One should act without attachment for the result; he should be disassociated from the modes of work. A man working in Krishna consciousness in a factory does not associate himself with the work of the factory, nor with the workers of the factory. He simply works for Krishna. And when he gives up the result for Krishna, he is acting transcendentally.
