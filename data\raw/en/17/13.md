विधिहीनमसृष्टान्नं मन्त्रहीनमदक्षिणम् ।  
श्रद्धाविरहितं यज्ञं तामसं परिचक्षते ॥१३॥

vidhi-hīnam asṛṣṭānnaḿ  
mantra-hīnam adakṣiṇam  
śraddhā-virahitaḿ yajñaḿ  
tāmasaḿ paricakṣate



### Translation:

**Any sacrifice performed without regard for the directions of scripture, without distribution of prasadam [spiritual food], without chanting of Vedic hymns and remunerations to the priests, and without faith is considered to be in the mode of ignorance.**

### Purport:

Faith in the mode of darkness or ignorance is actually faithlessness. Sometimes people worship some demigod just to make money and then spend the money for recreation, ignoring the scriptural injunctions. Such ceremonial shows of religiosity are not accepted as genuine. They are all in the mode of darkness; they produce a demoniac mentality and do not benefit human society.
