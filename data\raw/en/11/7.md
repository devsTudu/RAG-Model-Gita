इहैकस्थं जगत्कृत्स्नं पश्याद्य सचराचरम् ।  
मम देहे गुडाकेश यच्चान्यद् द्रष्टुमिच्छसि ॥७॥

ihaika-sthaḿ jagat kṛtsnaḿ  
paśyādya sa-carācaram  
mama dehe guḍākeśa  
yac cānyad draṣṭum icchasi



### Translation:

**O Arjuna, whatever you wish to see, behold at once in this body of Mine! This universal form can show you whatever you now desire to see and whatever you may want to see in the future. Everything -- moving and nonmoving -- is here completely, in one place.**

### Purport:

No one can see the entire universe while sitting in one place. Even the most advanced scientist cannot see what is going on in other parts of the universe. But a devotee like Arjuna can see everything that exists in any part of the universe. Krishna gives him the power to see anything he wants to see, past, present and future. Thus by the mercy of Krishna, Arjuna is able to see everything.
