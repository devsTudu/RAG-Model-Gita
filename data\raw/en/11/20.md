द्यावापृथिव्योरिदमन्तरं हि  
व्याप्तं त्वयैकेन दिशश्च सर्वाः ।  
दृष्ट्वाद्भुतं रूपमुग्रं तवेदं  
लोकत्रयं प्रव्यथितं महात्मन् ॥२०॥

dyāv ā-pṛthivyor idam antaraḿ hi  
vyāptaḿ tvayaikena diśaś ca sarvāḥ  
dṛṣṭvādbhutaḿ rūpam ugraḿ tavedaḿ  
loka-trayaḿ pravyathitaḿ mahātman



### Translation:

**Although You are one, You spread throughout the sky and the planets and all space between. O great one, seeing this wondrous and terrible form, all the planetary systems are perturbed.**

### Purport:

Dyav a-prithivyoh ("the space between heaven and earth") and loka-trayam ("the three worlds") are significant words in this verse because it appears that not only did Arjuna see this universal form of the Lord, but others in other planetary systems saw it also. Arjuna's seeing of the universal form was not a dream. All whom the Lord endowed with divine vision saw that universal form on the battlefield.
