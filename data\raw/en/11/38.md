त्वमादिदेवः पुरुषः पुराण-  
स्त्वमस्य विश्वस्य परं निधानम् ।  
वेत्तासि वेद्यं च परं च धाम  
त्वया ततं विश्वमनन्तरूप ॥३८॥

tvam ādi-devaḥ puruṣaḥ purāṇas  
tvam asya viśvasya paraḿ nidhānam  
vettāsi vedyaḿ ca paraḿ ca dhāma  
tvayā tataḿ viśvam ananta-rūpa



### Translation:

**You are the original Personality of Godhead, the oldest, the ultimate sanctuary of this manifested cosmic world. You are the knower of everything, and You are all that is knowable. You are the supreme refuge, above the material modes. O limitless form! This whole cosmic manifestation is pervaded by You!**

### Purport:

Everything is resting on the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He is the ultimate rest. Nidhanam means that everything, even the Brahman effulgence, rests on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna. He is the knower of everything that is happening in this world, and if knowledge has any end, He is the end of all knowledge; therefore He is the known and the knowable. He is the object of knowledge because He is all-pervading. Because He is the cause in the spiritual world, He is transcendental. He is also the chief personality in the transcendental world.
