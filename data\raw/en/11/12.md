दिवि सूर्यसहस्रस्य भवेद्युगपदुत्थिता ।  
यदि भाः सदृशी सा स्याद्भासस्तस्य महात्मनः ॥१२॥

divi sūrya-sahasrasya  
bhaved yugapad utthitā  
yadi bhāḥ sadṛśī sā syād  
bhāsas tasya mahātmanaḥ



### Translation:

**If hundreds of thousands of suns were to rise at once into the sky, their radiance might resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form.**

### Purport:

What Arjuna saw was indescribable, yet Sanjaya is trying to give a mental picture of that great revelation to Dhritarashtra. Neither Sanjaya nor Dhritarashtra was present, but Sanjaya, by the grace of Vyasa, could see whatever happened. Thus he now compares the situation, as far as it can be understood, to an imaginable phenomenon (i.e., thousands of suns).
