अर्जुन उवाच  
पश्यामि देवांस्तव देव देहे  
 सर्वांस्तथा भूतविशेषसंघान् ।  
ब्रह्माणमीशं कमलासनस्थ-  
 मृषींश्च सर्वानुरगांश्च दिव्यान् ॥१५॥

sarvāḿs tathā bhūta-viśeṣa-sańghān  
brahmāṇam īśaḿ kamalāsana-stham  
ṛṣīḿś ca sarvān uragāḿś ca divyān



### Translation:

**Arjuna said: My dear Lord Krishna, I see assembled in Your body all the demigods and various other living entities. I see Brahma sitting on the lotus flower, as well as Lord Siva and all the sages and divine serpents.**

### Purport:

Arjuna sees everything in the universe; therefore he sees Brahma, who is the first creature in the universe, and the celestial serpent upon which the Garbhodakasayi Vishnu lies in the lower regions of the universe. This snake bed is called Vasuki. There are also other snakes known as Vasuki. Arjuna can see from the Garbhodakasayi Vishnu up to the topmost part of the universe on the lotus-flower planet where Brahma, the first creature of the universe, resides. That means that from the beginning to the end, everything could be seen by Arjuna, who was sitting in one place on his chariot. This was possible by the grace of the Supreme Lord, Krishna.
