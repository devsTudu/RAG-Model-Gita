अर्जुन उवाच  
दृष्ट्वेदं मानुषं रूपं तव सौम्यं जनार्दन ।  
इदानीमस्मि संवृत्तः सचेताः प्रकृतिं गतः ॥५१॥

### Translation:

**When Arjuna thus saw Krishna in His original form, he said: O Janardana, seeing this humanlike form, so very beautiful, I am now composed in mind, and I am restored to my original nature.**

### Purport:

Here the words manusham rupam clearly indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be originally two-handed. Those who deride Krishna as if He were an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of His divine nature. If Krishna is like an ordinary human being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and again to show the four-handed Narayana form? So it is very clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita that one who thinks that Krishna is an ordinary person and who misguides the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within Krishna speaking is doing the greatest injustice. Krishna has actually shown His universal form and His four-handed Vishnu form. So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on Bhagavad-gita because he knows what is what. The original verses of Bhagavad-gita are as clear as the sun; they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators.
