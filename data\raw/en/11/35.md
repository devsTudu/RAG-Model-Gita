संजय उवाच  
एतच्छ्रुत्वा वचनं केशवस्य  
कृताञ्जलिर्वेपमानः किरीटी ।  
नमस्कृत्वा भूय एवाह कृष्णं  
सगद्गदं भीतभीतः प्रणम्य ॥३५॥

sañjaya uvāca  
etac chrutvā vacanaḿ keśavasya  
kṛtāñjalir vepamānaḥ kirītī  
namaskṛtvā bhūya evāha kṛṣṇaḿ  
sa-gadgadaḿ bhīta-bhītaḥ praṇamya



### Translation:

**Sanjaya said to Dhritarashtra: O King, after hearing these words from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the trembling Arjuna offered obeisances with folded hands again and again. He fearfully spoke to Lord Krishna in a faltering voice, as follows.**

### Purport:

As we have already explained, because of the situation created by the universal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna became bewildered in wonder; thus he began to offer his respectful obeisances to Krishna again and again, and with faltering voice he began to pray, not as a friend, but as a devotee in wonder.
