श्रीभगवानुवाच  
पश्य मे पार्थ रूपाणि शतशोऽथ सहस्रशः ।  
नानाविधानि दिव्यानि नानावर्णाकृतीनि च ॥५॥

śrī-bhagavān uvāca  
paśya me pārtha rūpāṇi  
śataśo 'tha sahasraśaḥ  
nānā-vidhāni divyāni  
nānā-varṇākṛtīni ca



### Translation:

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, O son of Pritha, see now My opulences, hundreds of thousands of varied divine and multicolored forms.**

### Purport:

Arjuna wanted to see Krishna in His universal form, which, although a transcendental form, is just manifested for the cosmic manifestation and is therefore subject to the temporary time of this material nature. As the material nature is manifested and not manifested, similarly this universal form of Krishna is manifested and nonmanifested. It is not eternally situated in the spiritual sky like Krishna's other forms. As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see Krishna in this way, Krishna reveals this form. This universal form is not possible to be seen by any ordinary man. Krishna must give one the power to see it.
