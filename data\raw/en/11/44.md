तस्मात्प्रणम्य प्रणिधाय कायं  
प्रसादये त्वामहमीशमीड्यम् ।  
पितेव पुत्रस्य सखेव सख्युः  
प्रियः प्रियायार्हसि देव सोढुम् ॥४४॥

tasmāt praṇamya praṇidhāya kāyaḿ  
prasādaye tvām aham īśam īḍyam  
piteva putrasya sakheva sakhyuḥ  
priyaḥ priyāyārhasi deva soḍhum



### Translation:

**You are the Supreme Lord, to be worshiped by every living being. Thus I fall down to offer You my respectful obeisances and ask Your mercy. As a father tolerates the impudence of his son, or a friend tolerates the impertinence of a friend, or a wife tolerates the familiarity of her partner, please tolerate the wrongs I may have done You.**

### Purport:

Krishna's devotees relate to Krishna in various relationships; one might treat Krishna as a son, or one might treat Krishna as a husband, as a friend, or as a master. Krishna and Arjuna are related in friendship. As the father tolerates, or the husband or a master tolerates, so Krishna tolerates.
