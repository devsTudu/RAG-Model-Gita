नमः पुरस्तादथ पृष्ठतस्ते  
नमोऽस्तु ते सर्वत एव सर्व ।  
अनन्तवीर्यामितविक्रमस्त्वं  
सर्वं समाप्नोषि ततोऽसि सर्वः ॥ ४०॥

namaḥ purastād atha pṛṣṭhatas te  
namo 'stu te sarvata eva sarva  
ananta-vīryāmita-vikramas tvaḿ  
sarvaḿ samāpnoṣi tato 'si sarvaḥ



### Translation:

**Obeisances to You from the front, from behind and from all sides! O unbounded power, You are the master of limitless might! You are all-pervading, and thus You are everything!**

### Purport:

Out of loving ecstasy for Krishna, his friend, Arjuna is offering his respects from all sides. He is accepting that He is the master of all potencies and all prowess and far superior to all the great warriors assembled on the battlefield. It is said in the Vishnu Purana (1.9.69):

yo 'yam tavagato deva

samipam devata-ganah

sa tvam eva jagat-srashta

yatah sarva-gato bhavan

"Whoever comes before You, be he a demigod, is created by You, O Supreme Personality of Godhead."
